# Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes

The Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes service is a fully-managed turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on what matters most, delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat and Microsoft SRE experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about infrastructure management. Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes provides seamless integration with a wide range of Azure compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes offers a reduced-cost solution to create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes cluster with a focus on efficiency. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

You subscribe to the service directly from your Azure account. After you create clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console, the Azure CLI, or the Azure Red Hat OpenShift REST API.

You receive OpenShift updates with new feature releases and a shared, common source for alignment with OpenShift Container Platform.

Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes uses [user-assigned managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to obtain credentials to manage infrastructure in your Azure account.

## Cluster node scaling

Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises. Easily add or remove compute nodes to match resource demand. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload.

## Fully managed underlying control plane infrastructure

Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red Hat-owned Azure account.

## Flexible, consumption-based pricing

Scale to your business needs and pay as you go with flexible pricing and an on-demand hourly or annual billing model.

## Single bill for Red Hat OpenShift and Azure usage

Customers will receive a single bill from Microsoft for both Red Hat OpenShift and Azure consumption.

## Fully integrated support experience

Installation, management, maintenance, and upgrades are performed by Red Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) with joint Red Hat and Microsoft support and a 99.95% service-level agreement (SLA).

## Azure service integration

Azure has a robust portfolio of cloud services, such as compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, and machine learning. All of these services are directly accessible through Azure Red Hat OpenShift with hosted control planes. This makes it easier to build, operate, and scale globally and on-demand through a familiar management interface.

## Maximum availability

Deploy node pools across multiple availability zones in supported regions to maximize availability and maintain high availability for your most demanding mission-critical applications and data.

## Optimized clusters

Choose from memory-optimized, compute-optimized, or general purpose virtual machine sizes with clusters sized to meet your needs.
